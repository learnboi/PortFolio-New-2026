# Images Folder

Please add your photos here with the following names:

1. **profile-hero.jpg** - This will be used in the hero section (the main landing area)
   - Recommended size: 800x800px or larger
   - Square aspect ratio works best
   - This will be displayed as a circular image

2. **profile-about.jpg** - This will be used in the About Me section
   - Recommended size: 600x800px or larger
   - Portrait orientation works best
   - This will be displayed as a rounded rectangle

## Image Tips

- Use high-quality images (at least 800px on the longest side)
- Ensure good lighting and clear visibility
- Crop images to focus on your face/upper body
- Save images as JPG format for smaller file sizes
- Optimize images before uploading (you can use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh)

## Quick Setup

1. Save your first photo as `profile-hero.jpg` in this folder
2. Save your second photo as `profile-about.jpg` in this folder
3. The website will automatically display them!

If you want to use different image names, update the `src` attributes in the component files.
